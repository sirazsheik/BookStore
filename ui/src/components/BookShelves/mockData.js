Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, 'the world's most influential living psychologist' (Steven Pinker) revolutionised our understanding of human behaviour with <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>.

A gripping heart-wrenching and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl as her father - a crusading local lawyer - risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\n\n<p><b>___________________________________</b><br><b>'Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'</b><br><br>A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man falsely charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.<br><br><i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</p>",

In The Ikigai Journey authors Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles take their international bestseller Ikigai the Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life a step further by showing you how to find your own ikigai through practical exercises such as employing new habits and stepping outside your comfort zone.. Ikigai is the place where our passion (what we love) mission (what we hope to contribute) vocation (the gifts we have to offer the world) and profession (how our passions and talents can become a livelihood) converge giving us a personal sense of meaning. This book helps you bring together all of these elements so that you can enjoy a balanced life.. Our ikigai is very similar to change it is a constant that transforms depending on which phase of life we are in. Our \"\"reason for being\"\" is not the same at 15 as it is at 70. Through three sections this book helps you to accept and embrace that―acting as a tool to revolutionize your future by helping you to understand the past so you can enjoy your present.. Section 1―Journey Through the Future Tokyo (a symbol of modernity and innovation)Section 2―Journey Through the Past Kyoto (an ancient capital moored in tradition)Section 3―Journey Through the Present Ise (an ancient shrine that is destroyed and rebuilt every twenty years). Japan has one of the longest life spans in the world and the greatest number of centenarians―many of whom cite their strong sense of ikigai as the basis for their happiness and longevity. Unlike many \"\"self-care\"\" practices which require setting aside time in an increasingly busy world the ikigai method helps you find peace and fulfillment in your busy life.",

Thank you Sadhguru.\"\"-Jay Naidoo Minister in President Nelson Mandela's cabinet recipient of the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur FranceA much-used word Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives of good actions and bad deeds of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.Through this book not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives he also tells us about the Sutras a step-by-step self help & self improvement guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process we get a deeper richer understanding of life and the power to craft our destinies. Review In his new bookKarma A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Your Destiny Sadhguru seeks to untangle the idea karma and explain its ideas to the readers.
